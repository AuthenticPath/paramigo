## Talking Points

This chapter helps clients take control of their debt by first categorizing it (high-interest vs low-interest, secured vs unsecured) and then creating a systematic plan for reduction. Many clients struggle with deciding whether to focus on debt repayment or investing; we'll help them understand when each makes mathematical sense while acknowledging that the psychological benefits of debt freedom may outweigh pure math for some.

For those with multiple debts, we'll explore both the **debt snowball** (smallest balance first) and **debt avalanche** (highest interest first) methods. Refinancing opportunities can be valuable tools, but we'll evaluate them carefully to ensure the costs don't outweigh the benefits. The ultimate goal is to help clients use debt strategically when it serves their goals while methodically eliminating burdensome debt that restricts their choices.

## Philosophy

At Abundo, we believe that not all debt is created equal, and our approach recognizes that some debt can be strategic (like low-interest mortgages) while other debt is destructive (like high-interest credit cards). We don't take a one-size-fits-all approach to debt elimination—instead, we help clients make intentional choices based on their unique financial situation and goals.

While we value the peace of mind that comes with debt freedom, we're also pragmatic about the opportunity costs of aggressive debt repayment versus investing. Our approach to refinancing is deliberately cautious—we analyze fees, interest savings, and time horizons to ensure clients genuinely benefit from any restructuring.

## Other Notes

Clients often have emotional associations with debt that can interfere with objective decision-making. Some may feel intense shame or anxiety around debt, leading to avoidance behaviors, while others may have become too comfortable with debt as a lifestyle enabler.

When discussing debt management, be sensitive to these emotional factors while still helping clients move toward more strategic choices. For couples, debt discussions can be particularly charged if they have different money scripts or if one partner brought significantly more debt into the relationship.

Also remain aware of unique considerations for different debt types—student loans have repayment options that other debts don't, while mortgage decisions should factor in tax implications and housing market conditions. Note the behavioral risk of refinancing: a consolidation loan or 0% transfer can lead to more total debt if chronic overspending is an issue.

## Tasks

### 1. Complete Your Debt Inventory

Create a comprehensive list of all debts, including creditor name, current balance, interest rate, minimum payment, payment due date, and estimated payoff date at current payment levels. Note whether each debt is fixed or variable rate, and whether it's secured by any assets. This gives you the complete picture needed to develop a strategic plan.

### 2. Evaluate Refinancing Opportunities

Research current interest rates for each type of debt you carry. For each debt, determine if refinancing might save you money by calculating total interest costs under current terms versus potential new terms. Remember to include any fees or closing costs in your calculations to determine true break-even points. Flag debts with the highest potential savings for immediate action.

### 3. Choose Your Debt Payoff Strategy

After reviewing the mathematical benefits of the **debt avalanche** method (highest interest first) and the psychological benefits of the **debt snowball** method (smallest balance first), select your preferred approach. Create a detailed payoff schedule with target dates for each debt and track your progress visually to maintain motivation.

### 4. Create Debt Reduction Acceleration Plan

Identify at least 3–5 specific actions you can take to accelerate your debt payoff, such as redirecting windfalls (tax refunds, bonuses, gifts), eliminating specific expenses temporarily, or generating additional income. Commit to specific dollar amounts from each source and add them to your debt payoff schedule.

### 5. Set Up Payment Automation

Automate minimum payments for all debts to avoid late fees and credit damage. For the debt you're prioritizing first, set up an additional automatic payment on a specific date each month to accelerate payoff. This removes the decision-making friction that often prevents consistent extra payments.

### 6. Establish Guardrails Against New Debt

Create specific guidelines for when you would consider taking on new debt in the future. Define what types of debt align with your values and financial goals (if any) and establish criteria any new debt must meet before you would consider it. Consider implementing a mandatory waiting period or consultation process before any new debt.

### 7. Create Celebration Milestones

Identify specific milestones in your debt payoff journey (25% paid, 50% paid, first debt completely eliminated, etc.) and plan meaningful but affordable celebrations for each achievement. Having planned rewards increases motivation and acknowledges the discipline required for successful debt reduction.

### 8. Review and Update Protection Strategies

Evaluate your insurance coverage and emergency fund in light of your debts. Ensure you have adequate protection to prevent a financial setback from derailing your debt payoff plan. Consider whether disability insurance or increased emergency savings might be needed while you're focusing on debt elimination.

### 9. Schedule Quarterly Debt Strategy Check-ins

Set calendar reminders to review your debt reduction progress and strategy every three months. During these check-ins, assess whether your chosen method is working, whether any refinancing opportunities have emerged, and whether your balance between debt payoff and other financial goals still feels appropriate.
